# Introduction

* Deregulation

* Profit oriented airlines ignore routes that serve remote regions

* Impaired accessibility to certain destination

* Subsidy schemes by transportation authorities
    &gt; - Procure air services
    &gt; - Pay subsidies to airlines
    &gt; - Subsidised routes

???
- Air trasportation started out as a regulated sector where governemts controlled route entry and exit, airfares.
- Increase in total number of passengers made some routes more attractive than others, led to monopolistic practices such as inflated air fares along some routes
- This led to governments deregulating air transportation, meaning airlines could freely choose new profitable routes and ignore/abandon the unprofitables ones
- As a result, profit oriented airlines ignore routes that serve remote regions if they have insufficient pax demand, which usually translates into unprofitability
- In a nutshell, dereguration impairs accessibility of people in small communities or remote regions to and from given destinations e.g., a mojor city, a hospital, and a hub or an international airport within a specified travel time. 
- This is a bad thing because it is not fair that part of the population may not access other regions and air transportation would provided their best chance. and even so, connecting these regions may have economic benefits for the whole country. crucial for economic social devpt
- To ensure accessibility to and from these regions, transportation authorities in Europe , the USA, Asia, and Austraria have these subsidy schemes where they procure air services: They pay subsidies to airlines who in turn provide air services.

# Procurement of Air Services

.center[
![:scale 100%](img/implementation_process.png)
]

&gt; .content-box-gray[Focus on Stage 1 and Stage 2]

???
- The procurement of of air services generally involves 3 stages: 

- it starts with an investigation of regions that need subsidised air services. Here they use measures such as travel time to reach certain destinations, for example, a capital city.
- then there is an auction where the transportation authority selects the airlines to provide air services and usually receive a subsidy.
- After the auction, the implementation starts where we experience actual service provision, payments.
-This process repeates every 2-5 years depending on the contract period of the specific country.
- 2 major problems, increasing subsidies spent by transportation authorities, and misuse of the subsidy scheme where some regions that for example have good train frequencies also get a subsidised route
- The first two task influence are key to solving dealing with these criticisms. For instance the investigation may be done more objectively and and the auction may be set up in a way that minimises the total subsidies to the airlines.
- So we focus on Stage 1 and Stage 2.

- 
1. Selection of subsidised routes
2. Auction for subsidised routes

### 2 Goals

1. To develop a model that can can objectively select an optimal set of subsidised routes.

2. To develop a model that can help the transportation authorities choose appropriate tendering requirements by studying how changes in these requirements may affect the subsidies, the airlines, and the passengers.

These lead to two goals, one dealing with the development of models

# Contributions

1. Develop a .content-box-gray[budget-constrained optimisation model] that selects an optimal set of subsidised routes from all possible routes based on givenaccessibility criteria.

--

2.  Propose a method to .content-box-gray2[estimate the subsidies of new routes]. This makes it possible to assesses all the possible subsidised routes.

--

3.  Develop .content-box-gray[an integrated auction framework] for the tendering process of subsidised routes.

--

4.  Develop a .content-box-gray2[bid-preparation model as an optimisation model] that is specific  to  subsidised  routes,  to  represent  the  airlines’  behaviour  in  the auction framework. The bidding airline is interested in minimising the subsidies subject to a target profit threshold.

--

5.  Propose a method to .content-box-gray[estimate the demand, which is appropriate for the origin–destination markets in subsidised schemes].

--

6.  .content-box-gray2[Estimate the route operation cost for the small aircraft types] that typically operate subsidised routes.  A model based on the small aircraft types—used to operate the subsidised routes—gives a more accurate cost estimate than a model based on bigger aircraft types,  which are more appropriate for commercially viable routes.

--

7.  .content-box-gray[Demonstrate the application of the models] using the Swedish subsidy scheme as a case study and suggest policy guidelines.

## PAPER I:
### Decision Support for an Optimal Choice of Subsidised Routes in Air Transportation

.pull-left[
- How to model the selection of routes to subsidise?

- Assist decision-makers in selecting an optimal network of subsidised routes

- .content-box-gray[Budgeted maximal coverage model]
]

.pull-right[
![:scale 100%](img/criteria_used.png)
]

???
- We use .content-box-blue[sweden] as a case study
- **Goal:** A mathematical model to assist decision makers in selecting an optimal network of subsidised routes
- The selection of routes is usually based on certain criteria, and travel time targets, In this paper, we look at 2 criteria and 5 targets
- The authorities would want to maximise the number of people with accessibility under these criteria but they have a limited budget so we formulate this subsidised route selection probem as a budgeted maximal coverage problem.

## A Budgeted maximal coverage model

.pull-left[
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
![:scale 100%](img/budgetedIP.png)
]

.pull-right[
- `\(y_p = 1\)` if center `\(p\)` is corvered; 0 otherwise

- `\(x_f = 1\)` if route `\(f\)` selected; 0 otherwise

- Maximise number of people with respect to an accessibility target `\(t\)`

- A budget `\(B\)` should not be exceeded

- Ground transportation, commercial route, or subsidised route
]

???
- we estimate the cost of subsidisation because this would be unknown for non-existing routes

- c 1.3 ensures that a population center does not use a a subsidised route if it satisfies the accessibility target using ground or a commercial route

.pull-right[
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
1. Better accessibility than current network but at a reduced subsidisation cost

2. Closure of an airport (e.g., BMA) with commercial traffic may require a subsidised route to as replacement
]

???
- We can do more with less money.
-

- The closure of an airport reduces the number of commercial routes, which would reduce the accessibility to a given destination

## PAPER II:
### Using an Auction to analyse the Tendering of Subsidised Routes in Air Transportation

.pull-left[
- How to model an auction that replicates the selection of airlines to serve subsidised routes?

- Assist decision-makers in setting up an auction for selecting airlines to provide subsidised air services

- .content-box-gray[An integrated auction framework]

]

???
- **Research question:** How to model an auction that replicates the selection of airlines to serve subsidised routes? 

- **Goal:** An &lt;span style:"color: blue;"&gt;integrated auction framework&lt;/span&gt; 
- Sweden as a case study
- We develop an integrated auction framework that starts with auction definition by the transportation authority. Here, the requiremnest of the maximum airfares and minimum number of flights are specified.
- The the airlines are called to bid and they prepare their bids taking into consideration the demand and the route operation cost. Specify the subsidy needed for their services
- The last step is for the transportation authority to select the winning airlines for each region.

## An integrated auction framework
#### The bid preparation model
.pull-left[

]

.pull-right[
- Minimise total subsidy `\(s\)` per bundle 

- Capture demand elasticity using a utility function: `\(d_a=D\frac{e^{U_{a}}}{1+e^{U_{a}}}\)`, `\(U_{a}(time, airfare)\)`
- Estimate route operating cost: `\(C(seat, distance)\)`

- Balance demand and capacity

- Profit threshold `\(\psi\)`

## An integrated auction framework
#### The Winner determination problem
.pull-left[

![:scale 100%](img/WDP.png)
]

.pull-right[
- Minimise total subsidy for serving all regions

- `\(x_b = 1\)` if bundle `\(b\)` is selected; 0 otherwise

- Each airline is wins atmost one bundle

## PAPER II: Conclusions

![:scale 100%](img/results_p2.png)
- No restriction on air fare and number of daily flights is good for the government

- Requirement on the minimum airfare gives a good balance between government subsidies and consumers surplus
---
class: slide-font_2
## Discussion and future research 
 
- Decision support models can be used to:
    &gt; - reduce government spending while improving accessibility
    &gt; - assess how requirements affect the results of the tendering process
    

- Solve the two task of the procurement process simultaneously

- Enhanced flight-scheduling component in the bid preparation model

- Re-designing subsidised routes based on electric

???
- of course this analysis is done using less criteria than what Trafikverket uses but future research can easily extend the model to include all criteria

- The auction framework assumes the regions in the auction definition determined in the investigation/selection stage of the procurement process.

- flight scheduling would better capture schedule delay
